# Data

In order to prepare the data:

1. Download cities dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/us-census-city-and-place-names
2. Extract `us-city-place-names.csv` to `data/raw` directory

# Poetry

The project uses poetry as the package manager. Learn more: https://python-poetry.org/

Poetry is not a strict requirement, but I use it daily and highly recommend it. If you don't feel comfortable
you can use pip/anaconda as well.
